 * The above address bounces and no current valid address
 * can be found. This version has changes by Craig Cockburn
 * plus various other minor corrections and changes
 *
 * 1.1.3: Amended error messages and allowed script to deal with new TLDs
 * 1.1.2: Fixed a bug where trailing . in e-mail address was passing
 *          (the bug is actually in the weak regexp engine of the browser; I
 *          simplified the regexps to make it work).
 * 1.1.1: Removed restriction that countries must be preceded by a domain,
 *          so abc@host.uk is now legal.
 *   1.1: Rewrote most of the function to conform more closely to RFC 822.
 *   1.0: Original
